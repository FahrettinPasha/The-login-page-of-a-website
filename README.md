üîÑ How to Integrate This Project Into Your Own System (Step-by-Step)

If you want to use this project inside your own system, follow these steps:
1. Copy Only What You Need

    Copy the templates/ folder to your own Flask app.

    Copy the static/ folder if you want to keep the same frontend.

    Merge the routes from main.py into your Flask backend. (Only copy the parts you need like register, login, etc.)

2. Database Integration

    This project uses SQLite. If you're using another database (e.g. PostgreSQL or MySQL), you can easily adapt the code.

    Update the database connection and queries as needed.

3. Email Verification Setup

    The send_verification_email() function in main.py uses Python‚Äôs smtplib. You can change the SMTP settings to match your provider (e.g. Gmail, Mailgun, etc.).

    Don't forget to allow access in your email account if using Gmail (or use an app password).

4. Customize the Design

    All styles are in static/styles.css, so you can change colors, layout, fonts, etc.

    The HTML is kept simple so you can easily integrate it with your own templates.

5. Test It!

    Before going live, always test registration, login, and email verification flows.

    You can manually view the database using DB tools like DB Browser for SQLite.
